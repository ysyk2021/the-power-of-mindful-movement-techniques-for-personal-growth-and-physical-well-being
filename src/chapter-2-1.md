Defining Mindful Movement
====================================================================

In this chapter, we will explore the definition of mindful movement and what it means to incorporate mindfulness into physical activity.

What is Mindful Movement?
-------------------------

Mindful movement involves bringing attention and awareness to the present moment while engaging in physical activity. This can include practices such as yoga, tai chi, meditation, or even simple movements like walking or stretching.

The practice of mindful movement involves being fully present in the moment, noticing sensations in the body, and focusing on the breath. By incorporating mindfulness into physical activity, we can deepen our mind-body connection and promote overall well-being.

How Does Mindful Movement Work?
-------------------------------

Mindful movement works by activating the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for relaxation and restorative processes in the body. This helps to reduce stress and tension, lower heart rate and blood pressure, and improve digestion and immune function.

In addition, mindful movement can help increase oxygen flow to the body, which can improve respiratory efficiency and promote overall physical health.
