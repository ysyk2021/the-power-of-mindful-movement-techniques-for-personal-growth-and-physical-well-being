Mindful walking and running can provide a deeper sense of connection to the body and the present moment while also promoting physical health. By focusing on the sensations of movement and breath, we can cultivate greater self-awareness and emotional regulation.

* Observing the sights and sounds around you without judgment or attachment
* Setting an intention for your walk, such as gratitude or compassion
* Incorporating gentle stretches or yoga poses at the beginning or end of your walk

Remember that mindful walking is not about speed or distance, but rather about being present in the moment and connecting with the body and surroundings.
